Networking has two sorts of IPs
- IPv4: 3.7 billion addresses
- IPv6: for Internet of Things



## Private vs Public IP (IPv4)
Public:
- the machine can be identified on the internet
- must be unique across web
- can be geo-located easily

Private:
- the machine can be identified on a private network only
- the ip must be unique across private network
- www -> internet gateway (proxy) -> machine
- there is dedicated range of IP for private IP


## Elastic IPs
- If you need to have a fixed public IP for EC2, you need Elastic IP.
- You can only have 5 Elastic IP in younr account
- Try to avoid using Elastic IP
  - use a random public IP and register a DNS to it
  - or use Load Balancer


## IP in AWS EC2
If your machine is stopped and then restarted, the public IP will change.
