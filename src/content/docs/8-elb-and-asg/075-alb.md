title: 075 Application Load Balancer
---

- Layer 7 (HTTP)
- Support HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP/2, WebSocket

Type
- Load balance to multiple HTTP apps across machines
- Load balance to multiple apps on the same machine (contains)

Routing table to different target groups
- Route based on path in URL
- Route based on hostname in URL (including subdomain)
- Route based on query, headers

Great for microservices & container-based app

A port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS



## ALB and HTTP Based Traffic
![Diagram](/8/075-http.png)
- Different microservices with same load balancer


## Target Groups
- EC2 instances (HTTP)
- ECS tasks (HTTP)
- Lambda functions (HTTP is translated into JSON)
- IP addresses (must be private IP)

ALB
- can route to multiple target groups 
- health checks at target group level


## Query based load balance
![Diagram](/8/075-query.png)


## ALB Good to know
Uses fixed hostname as public access

The servers don't see the IP of the client directly
- true IP of client is inserted in the header `X-Forwarded-For`
- We can also get `X-Forwarded-Port` and `X-Forwarded-Proto`
