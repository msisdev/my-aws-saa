title: 073 Elastic Load Balancer
---

## Load Balancer
A server that forwards traffic to multiple servers downstream


## Why use a load balancer?
- Spread load across multiple downstream instances
- Expose a single point of access (DNS) for your app
- Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
- Health check
- SSL termination (HTTPS)
- Enforce stickiness with cookies
- High availability across zones
- Separate public traffic from private traffic

## Why use Elastic Load Balancer
It is a managed load balancer
- AWS guarantess it will work
- AWS takes care of upgrade, maintenance, high availability
- AWS provides only a few config knobs

Your own load balancer
- cost less
- more effort

It is integrated with many AWS services
- EC2, EC2 Auto Scaling groups
- AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), CloudWatch
- Route 53, AWS WAF, AWS Global Accelerator


## Health Check
- Crucial for load balancers
- It enables the load balancer to know if instances are available to replay to requests
- It is done on a port and a route (common endpoint: `/health`)
- If response is not 200, then load balancer will not forward request


## Types of load balancer on AWS
Classic load balancer (2009)
- HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL

Application load balancer  (2016)
- HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket

Network load balancer (2017)
- TCP, TLS, UDP

Gateway load balancer (2020)
- Operates at network layer 3 (IP protocol)

> It is recommended to use the newer generation

> Some load balancers can be setup as internal or external ELB


## Load Balancer Security Groups
Load balancer security group:
- Looks like normal security group

Application security group:
- Allow traffic only from the load balancer
  - Set `Source` as specific security group (which is load balancer)
