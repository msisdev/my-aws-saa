title: 068 EFS
---

- Managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on many EC2
- EFS works with EC2 instances in multi-AZ
- Highly available, scalable, expensivee (3x gp2)

Use cases
- content management, web serving, data sharing, Wordpress

Property
- NFSv4 protocol
- Uses security group to control access from each AZ in a region
- Compatible with Linux AMI
- Encryption at rest using KMS
- POSIX file system with standard file API
- File system scales automatically
- pay-per-use, no capacity planning


## Performance
Throughput mode
- **Bursting**: 50MiB/s, burst up to 100MiB/s
- **Provisioned**: set thgroughput regardless of storage size
- **Elastic**: automatically scale throughput (recommended)

Performance mode (set at EFS creation)
- **General purpose**: latensy-sensitive use cases (web server, CMS, etc)
- **Max I/O**: higher latency/throughput/parallel (big data, media processing)

Elastic mode cannot use Max I/O performance mode.


## Storage Classes
Storage tiers
- **Standard**: for frequently accessed files
- **Infrequent access (EFS-IA)**: cost to retrieve files, lower price to store
- **Archive**: rarely accessed files, 50% cheaper

Implement lifecycle policy to move files between storage tiers

Availability and durability
- **Standard**: Multi-AZ, for production
- **One Zone**: for development, backup enabled by default, compatible with EFS-IA
